## Introduction

ScreenConnect is a dedicated remote access utility that functions as the endpoint component within the ScreenConnect ecosystem, enabling secure and reliable connections between technicians and user devices. Designed to support a broad range of IT workflows, the client facilitates remote troubleshooting, system diagnostics, device monitoring, and administrative operations with minimal impact on system performance. Its lightweight architecture ensures fast deployment and stable connectivity, even in environments with limited bandwidth or diverse hardware configurations.

Once installed, ScreenConnect-Client establishes an encrypted communication channel to the organization’s ScreenConnect server, allowing authenticated operators to create on-demand or persistent sessions. Through this connection, technicians gain access to real-time screen sharing, file transfer tools, clipboard synchronization, and command shell interfaces such as Terminal or PowerShell. These capabilities allow support teams to resolve issues efficiently without requiring physical access to devices, reducing downtime and improving response times across the organization.

Security is a fundamental element of ScreenConnect-Client’s design. The client uses modern encryption standards, secure session tokens, and customizable authorization levels to ensure that only approved personnel can interact with a connected device. Administrators can configure granular permissions, restricting actions such as system control, file manipulation, or command execution to specific roles. This approach provides a strong security posture while allowing organizations to tailor access policies to their operational requirements.

ScreenConnect-Client is also well-suited for enterprise-scale deployments. It can be distributed across large device fleets using automated installation scripts, group policies, or third-party deployment systems. Once active, the client operates quietly in the background, maintaining communication with the server and enabling technicians to access devices during scheduled maintenance windows or urgent support events. By supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, it provides the adaptability needed for infrastructures that span different operating systems.
